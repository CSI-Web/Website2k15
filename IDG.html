                           “INTEREST DEVELOPMENT GROUPS(IDGs)" is a platform to enhance your skills a learn a lot more.Special classes on coding, Android development, web development, etc. are organised by the third and fourth year seniors. The classes are held on weekly basis .For around 90% of us when we come to college we actually are not aware of our interests and the area we actually wants to work in. Infact  we are also not aware of the courses and platforms that exist on which we can make our career. So this is the place where you can actually focus and work on what you are really interesred in .When students come in first year we organise a different IDGs thought a week which is “open for all students” so that they can attend and know about courses and can actually decide what they are interested in .These IDGs really help as you get a brief introduction about the topics. After that the IDGs are conducted on weekly basis for CSI members only.The seniors may involve you in their projects if the find it you worth it :)
