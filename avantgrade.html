                            "Avantgarde" is a techinical week organised just after our tiring mid sems exams.It is a 3-4 days event with  many competitions. This event is the first event, where you as first years would be part of the event, both as organisers as well as participants. From coding events, to LAN gaming to quizzing to debating, you name it and we have it. Aimed at making you compete with others who share the same passion, this fest is a great way to start building your CVs. This 3-4 day event not only includes various competitions, but also includes various workshops. Last year, we had workshops on augmented reality, game theory and machine learning, each of which is an important as well as interesting field of study. The first years get a chance to interact and work with seniors and them well.All that matters is the confidence and leadership qualities ,which can be developed by organising, participating or being a part of such events in any way possible. And, well, who doesnâ€™t like prizes and certificates! So gear yourself for this one week of technical as well as non-technical extravaganza!
