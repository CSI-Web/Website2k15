                            Meet Us and Join Us - The most interactive, fun loving and advanced techno-management society of DTU. Face-to-face orientation to know who we are and what we do and our vision. Its 1PM, and your teacher is teaching you AP-AC and suddenly, this one senior peeps through the class door and asks, “Sir can I speak to the class for 2 min! Sir, it won’t take long, just 2 min?” Experienced that already? Well, those are your second years, who will come to your class introducing their respective societies to you. Telling you how they are better, how they carry out the most exclusive range of events and much more about their societies. We would be doing (if haven’t done already) the same. But more than the class to class society-introduction, we urge you to attend the orientation.

                        CSI orientation is a 1-1.5 hour event, held after college hours for everyone interested in joining our society. Aimed at providing you all the essential details about our society, this event, organised by the second years, is a must-attend event. We provide you a brief account of everything that we do throughout the year. And don’t worry; it is not one of those conventional boring orientations that you think it’d be. Being your seniors, we highly recommend you to attend the orientation. Not just CSI orientation, but the orientation of any society that you wish to join. Hope to see you there then .
