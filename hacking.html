                            "Ethical Hacking & Cyber Forensics" workshop is organised by CSI-DTU. It is a 2 day workshop (total of 16 hours) meant for all those interested in learning hacking and cyber security.We collaborate with different security consulting firms and conduct the workshop. You must have encountered the word “hacking” many times and you must have wandered what it actually is as some people treat it “ILLEGAL” while some treat it “LEGAL”  Hacking is not always about the illegal things it's all about how to secure your system. In the two days workshop Google Hacking, Email Hacking, Dos Attacks, Torjens, SQL Injection, Windows Hacking, Mobile Hacking etc. topics are covered. This workshop aims to give Technocrats a basic knowledge of hacking and how to protect your system against hazardous effects.
