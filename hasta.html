                            "Hasta la Vista" is the Fuchcha Week organised, co-ordinated and volunteered completely by first year members of the Computer Society of India-DTU Chapter. It's the chance to participate in some simple mind games and grab prizes, fuchchas! So come on, and admist enjoyment, have the best you can before the end-sems begin.....before the year ends! It may be the first experience for you to organise and event too.This is the one fest that, you, first years will especially like. Because the complete responsibility for this fest is on the first years. You conceive the events, you plan them, you organise them and you conduct them. The complete onus is on you. And the events here are absolutely non-technical. Held around the last week of April, hasta la vista aka fuchcha week, had events like game-o-droid (students had to compete in android games like fruit ninja, 2048 etc), pixelf (best selfie out of the many entries we received was chosen as the winner), know your campus (quiz on the various locations in campus) was held, among others! 
                            So brace yourself to organise this entire week of creativity and enthusiasm :)
